## persistent-class-example: Persistent Python class example with Shelve and SQLite
This is an example of persistent Python classes using both Shelve and SQLite. There is a superclass named Persistent that saves the subclasses on a Shelve and loads the previous status on each init. On the other hand, some classes use SQLite to save the data and get it for later use.

It uses product advertising API to fetch basic data and web scraping to get more specific data not provided by the Amazon API like flash prices.
